# Symbian-SDL
Archive for ancient stuff

I hear that there are still developers working with NGage games. To support that work I publish here the latests (as far as I able to find anything from my ancient backups) Symbian SDL version. 

If I can recall right, the official SDL (at the time), did not have the latest Symbian SDL version and this sdk-1.2.14-s60-2.4.5/SDL_install/sdl_source  folder is supposed to patch it.

please note that the associated "install.bat" refers to sdk_source.zip, that is just he sdl_source folder zipped, and I extracted that into repo to be git-friendly.


I wish Symbian SDL brings some joy.


This repository also contains:

* sinvanders, the only game I did using the Symbian-SDL.
* futils is a utility library.
